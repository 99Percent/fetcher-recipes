         ** Ember Data is still in betaâ€”this download is from a beta channel! **

         You may need to order your vendored libs in "config/files.js" like so:

         js: {
           vendor: [
             "vendor/js/jquery.js",
             "vendor/js/handlebars-runtime.js",
             "vendor/js/ember.js",
             "vendor/js/ember-data.js",
             "vendor/js/**/*.js"
           ]
         }
         """
