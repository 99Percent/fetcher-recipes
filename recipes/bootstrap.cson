         1. Bootstrap's sourcemap files include references to the development
         .less file sources so you'll see an error when you start unless you
         modify `config/application.js` to add the following configuration:
         
         concat_sourcemap: {
           options: {
             sourcesContent: false
           }
         }

         2. Bootstrap's JavaScript dependency requires jQuery. If your project
         doesn't already include jQuery, then you may choose to add it (e.g.
         `lineman fetch jquery`), or you can delete `vendor/js/bootstrap.js`
         if you don't intend to use Bootstrap's JS library.

         You may need to order your vendored libs in "config/files.js" like so:

         js: {
           vendor: [
             "vendor/js/jquery.js",
             "vendor/js/**/*.js"
           ]
         }
         """
